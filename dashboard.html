    <h2>Bubble Map</h2>
    <p>This bubble map gives visual representation to crime rates and unemployment rates, compared to population. Larger state populations will be represented by larger circles, whereas smaller circles denote a smaller state population. Lighter colored circles indicate low crime rates and unemployment rates, with circles getting darker as those values increase. The user can click through different years and crimes to see the map change. Users can also select each bubble for a breakdown of state name, population size, crime rate per 100,000 people, and unemployment rate.</p>

    <h2>Time Series Plot</h2>
    <p>A time series plot is amore holistic way to represent state crime rates and unemployment rates from 2014-2022. As you see here, it allows for the visualization of trends, patterns, and relationships so that we can see change over time. This represents a more high-level overview of the data we obtained. One important thing to note, is that this plot allows viewers to understand that both variables will not typically change simultaneously. For example, crime rates may not immediately respond to change in unemployment rates, but you can see that change starts to occur. This time series plot is interactive, and the user scan select a crime and/or a state, to view how they relate to unemployment rates over time.</p>

    <h2>Crime Rate Choropleth Map</h2>
    <p>This choropleth map returns the r-values and p-values for the correlation between unemployment and crime rate. The drop down menu will allow you to filter for each type of crime, and you can click on each state to get the r-value and p-value for that state. Additionally, states that are red indicate a negative correlation, and states that are green indicate a positive correlation.</p>
